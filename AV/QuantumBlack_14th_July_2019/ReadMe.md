Evaluation Criteria & Rules-

Least deviation from the actual result would decide the accuracy of the output.
For engine and drive features, we are going to use the absolute percent deviation in between pre-calculated output versus the output provided by you. For weather features, it is going to be calculated as per mean percentage deviation from the actual output.
The final score is calculated using the deviation scores after applying weights as follows
Score = 100[W1(1- engine_deviation) + W2(1- drive_deviation) + W3(1- weather_deviation)]

Quality of code would be judged on the following parameters â€“ functionality, reusability, modularity, documentation, testing and validation.
Should be scalable to be executed on 5 GB data as well.
Please note that scoring is going to be done using an automated script and difference in between the field names or order from the above-defined feature may result in zero scoring/error message due to the failure of the scoring script.
Participants may do multiple submissions. They would have to select on the platform which one to be treated as the final submission. If not selected, the submission with the highest score would be considered as final.
Final winners would be announced only after the submitted code reviews and the analysis of the rest of the document submissions made by the participants.
Only 5 submissions per day are allowed
